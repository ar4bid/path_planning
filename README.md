# path_planning

This personal project was undertaken to continue my practice in Javascript and to explore my interest in path planning algorithms. 

Currently Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented but in the future I will implement A* and others.

You can run the project in it's current state using github pages at https://ar4bid.github.io/path_planning/.

### To-do:
* Make tile type more explicit or at least give the user info on which tile is what. (green start, red end, gray wall).
* Fix the clear page button so it resets all necessary variables so that the algorithm can be run again without a page reload.
* Implement A* algorithm.
